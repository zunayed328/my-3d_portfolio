AI Prompt (use this exact template):
"A high-detail 3D render of the [LANGUAGE NAME] logo, micro-3D isometric style, made of glowing frosted glass and neon circuits, center-focused, soft ambient occlusion, high resolution, dark background, transparent PNG style, professional tech aesthetic."

Replacements:
- Python: Replace [LANGUAGE NAME] with "Python Snake"
- Java: Replace [LANGUAGE NAME] with "Java Coffee Cup"
- C/C++: Replace [LANGUAGE NAME] with "Blue C++ Shield"

Usage notes:
- Use 1:1 aspect ratio, high resolution (ideally 8k or maximum available), and export as PNG with transparent background.
- Recommended modifiers: subtle volumetric fog, neon rim lighting (cyan / purple for Python, amber / blue for Java, cyan / royal blue for C++), glossy frosted glass material, crisp reflections, isometric camera angle, center composition.
- Suggested generators: Midjourney, Stable Diffusion (img2img with depth/SDXL), or DALL·E. Add generator-specific quality flags as needed.

Save outputs as `python.png`, `java.png`, `cpp.png` in either `public/icons/` (preferred) or `src/assets/tech/`.

If you want, I can:
- (A) Call an image-generation API for you (I will need your API key and permission). 
- (B) Generate a small script you can run locally to batch-generate these images with Stable Diffusion (requires a local GPU).
- (C) Provide step-by-step Midjourney instructions for the prompts.
